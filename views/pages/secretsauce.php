                        Our clients tell us they are excited by this new lifestyle and the ability to achieve and maintain optimal
                        health. A few, although excited, confess to feeling a bit overwhelmed by making these changes. Even
                        though they’ve tried everything else and nothing worked… and this makes so much sense
                        </p>

                        Knowing what emotional reactions to expect equips you to address them as they appear and to keep
                        moving forward. Even though excitement is genuine, feelings of being overwhelmed can paralyze a
                        person.
